# Flow

Flow is a set of cross-platform libraries for RubyMotion. Each library implements the following requirements:

* 100% cross-platform API for iOS and Android
* No external dependencies
* Fully covered by tests
* Fully documented (in the future ;-))

## Libraries

Flow is currently composed of several libraries:

* [**Flow::Net**](https://github.com/jjaffeux/Flow/tree/master/flow/net) - HTTP networking
* [**Flow::JSON**](https://github.com/jjaffeux/Flow/tree/master/flow/json) - JSON serialization
